As you approach the tower, you feel a strange sense of fearful apprehension. There's something about this place that just doesn't feel right, but you've come too far to turn back now. You've heard the stories about this place; everyone has.

You ascend the stairs, taking in the eerie silence that surrounds you. The only sounds you hear are the wind and the birds it carries with it as you climb to the tower entrance. Finally, you reach the main door and step into a small room. You turn to close the door behind you, and that's when it happens.

A sudden, sharp pain lances through the back of your skull, and you realize that someone has struck you from behind. You try to fight back, but your vision blurs, and you collapse to the ground. Your last thought before losing consciousness: "Is this it? Is this how I die?"
