ADVENTURE!

Project Description
This project is a simple game written in Python, a text-based adventure game, where the player must navigate through a series of rooms and solve puzzles in order to progress to the next level.

The game consists of a main script (game.py) and several other Python modules that implement various game mechanics, such as room generation (room.py), enemies encounters, and game logic (game_logic.py). The game uses the standard Python random library to generate random rooms and puzzles, so every playthrough will be different.

The game is designed to be simple and accessible for beginners with no prior programming experience, but it still demonstrates some of the core concepts covered in the CS50 course.

Installation and Usage
To run the game, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the game files from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/paredessimonati/Proyecto-python

To run the game, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the game files. Then, run the following command: 

                                ┌────────────────────┐
                                │                    │
                                │   python game.py   │  
                                │                    │
                                └────────────────────┘


This will start the game, and you will be presented with a series of prompts to navigate through the game.

Game Mechanics
The game consists of a series of rooms, each with its own unique puzzle that must be solved in order to progress to the next room. The player must navigate through the rooms by typing commands at the prompt, such as "go north", "take key", or "use hammer".

The game also includes various items that the player can pick up and use to solve puzzles, such as keys, hammers, and levers. These items can be stored in the player's inventory and used at any time.

The game tracks the player's progress and saves the state of the game between sessions, so the player can continue their progress at a later time.
